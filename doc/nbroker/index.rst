nBroker
=======

Achieving full network visibility requires a combination of a wide range of monitoring tools for real-time analysis.
It is really important to efficiently steer traffic from the network to each tool that needs it, or to filter it both
to do selective analysis reducing the load on the monitoring tools, or to block it in inline applications.
nBroker is a framework that can be used for configuring traffic steering and filtering at 100 Gbit on Intel RRC chipsets (FM10K).
